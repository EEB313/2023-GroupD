# 2023-GroupD

This is a hypothesis-driven project. We are testing the following hypotheses. 

1. The intensity of artificial light at night affects the frequency of bird-building collisions (alpha = 0.05). 
2. The frequency of bird-building collisions varies among species (alpha = 0.05).

Group work was divided by the following predictions. 

* Prediction 1a, the frequency of bird-building collisions increases with the intensity of artificial light: **Samina Hess**. 
* Prediction 2a, the frequency of bird-building collisions increases in species with lower wing maneuverability: **Yunhua Ren**. 
* Prediction 2b, the frequency of bird-building collisions is lower in omnivore species than in non-omnivore species: **Leslie Gao**. 

The contents of the group repository are as follows. 

**Data (raw and processed)**:

* Bird-building collision data from Winger et al. (Chicago_collision_data.csv). 
* Collision data in wide format (Chicago_collision_data_wide.csv). 
* Names of species in collision data (Bird_sci_name.csv). 
* Light intensity data from Winger et al. (Light_levels_dryad.csv). 
* Bird body mass and wingspan data from Avibase (Bird_Mass_Wingspan_Windload.csv). 
* Processed bird body mass and wingspan data (merged_data.csv). 
* Trophic level of each species from Avibase (trophic_level.csv). 

**Analyses**:

* Analyses for Prediction 1 (prediction_1.Rmd). 
* An .Rmd file to extract species names from collision data (Name_extract.Rmd). 
* Analyses for Prediction 2a (2a_data_cleaning_merging.Rmd, 2a_data_analysis.Rmd). 
* Analyses for Prediction 2b (prediction_2b.Rmd). 

**Other files**:

* This README.md file. 
* Project proposal (EEB313_Project_Proposal.pdf). 
* Mid-project update (Mid-project update.pdf). 
* Presentation slides.
